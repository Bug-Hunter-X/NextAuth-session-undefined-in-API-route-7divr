# NextAuth Session Undefined in API Route

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using NextAuth.js for authentication in API routes. The problem is that the `unstable_getServerSession` function returns `null` even when a user is logged in. This issue usually arises from a misconfiguration of NextAuth or incorrect usage of its API.

## Problem
The API route attempts to retrieve the session using `unstable_getServerSession`. However, due to some factors (misconfiguration, incorrect setup), it fails to obtain the session details. This leads to unauthorized access, even for logged-in users.

## Solution
The solution involves verifying the NextAuth configuration and ensuring the correct usage of the `unstable_getServerSession` function in the API route. Specifically, it is essential to check the `authOptions` object for correctness and ensure the session is correctly persisted and handled in the NextAuth configuration file.
